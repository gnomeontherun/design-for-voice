title: Episode 13 – Conversational Maxims
category: podcast
---

Many of the conversational design principles are based on the idea of the cooperative principle, which states people work together cooperatively in conversation. The principle was defined by Linguist Paul Grice, and it is supported by four conversational maxims, with a fifth being added from linguist, Robin Lakoff. These simple maxims make the foundation for much of voice design. Erika Hall joins the show to give a detailed look at these maxims, which are the Maxim of Quality, Quantity, Relation, Manner and Politeness, and you’ll learn how to apply these ideas into your conversational interfaces and experiences.

### Guest – Erika Hall

Erika Hall is the co-founder and Director of Strategy at Mule. She has advocated for the importance of evidence-based design and strong language since the late 20th century. This represents decades of fisticuffs.

Even though writing is ever so much harder than talking, she was driven to produce Just Enough Research and Conversational Design, both from A Book Apart. Erika loves helping people overcome the often invisible organizational barriers to doing good work.
